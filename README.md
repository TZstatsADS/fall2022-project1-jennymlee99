### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Exploring the quotes between the great philosophers
+ This project is conducted by [Jenny Li]

+ Project summary: In this project, I tried to explore the quotes between the great philosophers and see what we can find out. Maybe philosophers from the same school like to quotes each other, maybe there are a few very influential philosophers that have been mentioned a lot in later generations, or maybe the more a philosopher is mentioned in an article, the more they share perspectives and ideas.
